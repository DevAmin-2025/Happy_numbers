# Happy Number Checker
This project provides a Python script to determine whther a given number is a `happy number`.
A happy number is defined as a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit.
If a number does not reach 1, it falls into a cycle and is not a happy number.

## Functions
- `is_happy_number(number: int) -> bool`: Determines if the input number is a happy number.
- `print_happy(text: str)`: Prints a colorful message indicating the number is happy.
- `print_not_happy(text: str)`: Prints a colorful message indicating the number is not happy.
- `print_info(text: str)`: Prints general information messages.
